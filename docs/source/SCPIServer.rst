SCPIServer.py
=============

This module provides a server for SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) communication. It uses SCPIParser extensively to handle SCPI commands and responses. It also uses the `CouplingMeasurement.py` module to perform the actual measurements.
It is specific to this instrument and is not a general-purpose SCPI server.
